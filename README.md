# Computer Vision and Machine Learning Notebooks

A comprehensive collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key projects in **Pattern Recognition**, **Mathematical Morphology**, **Image Processing & Restoration**, and **3D Mesh Processing & Face Expression Analysis**. Each notebook includes step-by-step explanations, practical implementations, and detailed comments to make advanced computer vision and ML concepts accessible.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into the following modules:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Implementations of essential techniques such as Hu's 7 Moments, Ghorbel's complex moments invariance, and Jan Flusser's rotation invariants. These techniques are foundational for recognizing patterns and extracting features from images.

2. **Mathematical Morphology**: Exploration of core morphological operations, including geodesic dilation reconstruction, erosion-dilation, and advanced transformations like Laplacian and top-hat. These methods are crucial for analyzing and modifying image structures.

3. **Image Processing and Restoration**: Covers key image processing concepts like DFT/IDFT, fast Fourier transform (FFT), Gaussian and motion blurring, kernel-based filtering, and Wiener filters. The section also includes introductory work in deep learning for image restoration.

4. **3D Mesh Processing & Face Expression Analysis**: Focused on processing 3D face meshes and analyzing facial expressions using geodesic distances, statistical analysis, and other advanced techniques. Topics include:
   - Calculating geodesic distances on facial meshes.
   - Extracting level curves for expression representation.
   - Statistical analysis for expression classification.
   - Implementing PCA and LDA to optimize face descriptors and improve feature extraction.

## Research Papers and Resources
Relevant research papers and references will be linked within each notebook where applicable. Some papers may also be provided directly in this repository (where permissions allow) to support in-depth understanding of specific techniques and algorithms.

## Goals
This project aims to provide:
- A practical reference for students, researchers, and developers interested in foundational and advanced topics in computer vision and ML.
- Continuous updates with new notebooks, improved explanations, and additional resources to deepen the repositoryâ€™s educational value.

Feel free to explore, clone, and contribute to this repository to expand on these core topics or add new ones. Suggestions and contributions are welcome!
